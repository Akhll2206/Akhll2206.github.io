<p style="text-align: center;"> I am very fond of Business and plan to go into that field when I'm older. I believe that business is the perfect field of study for me to go into as all my life I've wanted to go into the business field. This story originates to when I was about 7 years old, I was on the way back from school and my parents asked me what I wanted to do when I'm older. I then proceeded to ask them what the job which makes the most money is. They said a businessman, so I thouht to myself then in that moment. I want to be a businessman.</p>
