<p style="text-align: center;">I like PC's and have been researching and watching videos about them for years. I recently built my own computer. It was for my birthday earlier in the year. Since then I have helped 3 of my friends find components, make purchases and then gone over to their house to help build their PC with them. That's been what I have been doing this year and I have had so much fun doing it with them. Currently I want to build a Computer keyboard for my next birthday.</p>
